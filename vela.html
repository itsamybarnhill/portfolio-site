        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          Water sport enthusiasts such as surfers, kayakers, and snorkelers want
          their activities on the water to be relaxing and fun, not stressful.
          To avoid any mishaps, it’s important to check the winds, waves and
          weather conditions before heading out. This can help us avoid hazards
          and be fully prepared for a day full of surfing, diving, or sailing.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Weather apps do exist for water sport enthusiasts, however what is
          currently available doesn’t do a great job of displaying complicated
          weather data in an accessible, easy to understand manner.
        </p>
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
          Watersport enthusiasts such as sailors, surfers, and divers need a way
          to receive accurate weather data presented in an easy to comprehend
          and visually attractive way, so that they can make informed decisions
          about participating in water sports.
        </p>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Create a product that offers current conditions information, graphs,
          and future forecasts all beautifully displayed and easy to read at a
          glance, geared specifically for the needs of water sport enthusiasts.

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          As part of my research, it was important to understand competitors in
          the same space were doing well, and discover what opportunities might
          exist for my project. I selected two apps with similar features,
          Waterspeed and Windy. To analyze, I created a marketing profile for
          each competitor, prepared a SWOT analysis, and performed a UX and
          features analysis of each competitor.

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted interviews with three individuals sourced from my personal
          network. The interviews were conducted remotely over Zoom.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <ul class="new-style"></ul>
          <li>
            How much time do you normally spend checking a mobile weather app?
          </li>
          <li>What parts of a weather app do you use the most?</li>
          <li>What device would you normally use when checking the weather?</li>
          <li>Tell me about a time you were frustrated with a weather app?</li>
          <li>What is your goal when you are checking a weather report?</li>
          <li>How much time do you spend on water sports per week?</li>
          <li>

        <br>

        <h4>Quotes</h4>
        <p>
          “It’s always an awesome feeling when I wake up in the morning, check
          the surf report and see that the conditions are going to be just
          right” -User Interviewee
        </p>

        <p>
          “Knowing the shorebreak really well is so important for safety,
          especially where I live. Staying aware of the ocean conditions is
          super important, they change fast” -User Interviewee
        </p>

        <p>
          “I check weather about five minutes at a time, usually once in the
          morning, and throughout the day, to see what’s happening on radar” -
          User Interviewee
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Discoveries</h4>
        <ul class="new-style"></ul>
          <li>
            Users reported they are looking at specific conditions reports the
            most, including wave swell size, tide report, and wind direction.
            Other specific reports mentioned were temperature, live radar, the
            uv index, and time of sunrise/sunset.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overall, the users I interviewed reported checking their mobile
            weather app of choice at least once per day, in approximately five
            minute increments. Interviewees reported that they check the weather
            more than once on days when they are planning to do water sports,
            usually closer to 2-3 times per day.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users reported they generally use a mobile phone to check the
            weather, occasionally a tablet or iPad, and even more occasionally a
            desktop. Users also reported they do generally bring their phone or
            device with them, but not necessarily while actively participating
            in water sports. One interviewee reported they sometimes use a
            waterproof case with lanyard while paddle boarding
          </li>
          <li>
            Interviewees reported that a good day on the water consisted of
            ideal weather conditions, not forgetting anything they needed for
            the day like snacks/sunscreen, avoiding overcrowded beaches, and
            avoiding jellyfish.
          </li>
          <li>
            Interviewees reported a bad day or a “no go” day on the water
            consisted of going out to surf and not catching any waves,
            overcrowding at beaches/shore breaks, and dangerous conditions such
            as rip currents or sharks.
          </li>

        <h3>User Personas</h3>
        <p>
          I developed two user personas based on the data I had gathered.
          Raymond, a 28 year old realtor who has been surfing all his life, and
          Shelby, a 29 year old teacher who has just recently taken up paddle
          boarding as a hobby.

        <h3>User Journey Maps</h3>
        <p>
          After analyzing, I felt I had gained a deeper understanding of what
          the User Personas needed. Now for the fun to begin! I put on my
          creative thinking cap and sat down to brainstorm some ideas to help
          meet those needs. As part of this, I developed two user journey maps
          for personas Raymond and Shelby.

          <li>
            Water sports contribute to user’s quality of life by providing them
            an outlet for fun and/or stress relief
          </li>
          <li>
            Users want to be aware of water and atmospheric conditions so they
            can plan to participate when conditions are optimal 2) Maximize
            safety
          </li>
          <li>
            Users felt that mainstream weather apps provide good data, but may
            not provide data in an engaging manner that is specific to user’s
            needs
          </li>
          <li>
            Users don’t necessarily want to develop a deep proficiency with
            interpreting weather maps and data
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Targeted Feature Ideas</h3>
        <ul class="new-style"></ul>
          <li>
            A feature allowing users to set weather condition parameters and
            receive notifications when those parameters are met.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accurate and straightforward reports of weather data including Air,
            Water, and Atmospheric conditions
          </li>

        <h3>Mid Fi Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          I developed mid fidelity wireframes for the three major features of

        <p>
          Usability testing was conducted remotely with six participants over
          the span of the week. During the test we had the participants interact
          with the Prototype and complete a series of short tasks. Our test
          objectives were to determine how quickly users were able to understand
          what the features of the app do, and also we wanted to observe how
          users would navigate through the app and if they're able to find what
          they needed quickly and easily through the navigation.

        <h3>Test Results</h3>
        <p>
          The top three usability issues that we discovered during testing were:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul class="new-style"></ul>
          <li>
            Users were confused on where to find the ocean swell forecast. Users
            anticipated that ocean swell would be located under the “water”
            bucket, when in fact the data was placed under the “Air” bucket, as
            swell is caused by wind.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users were confused by the search function when asked to set their
            location in the app. This was because the search function prototype
            did not indicate clearly where the user could type.
          </li>
          <li>
            When users created a weather alert, there was confusion because
            there was no clear indiction when the user had completed the task.
            In this instance, the toggle that indicated an alert had been
            created did not move to the “on” position.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div><h1 id="refine">Refine</h1></div>
      <div>
        <p>
          After usability testing was completed, I sat down with the high
          fidelity wireframes to further refine the design. I incorporated the
          fixes suggested by testing, including changing the location of certain
          data, and making some changes to the search function to improve
          usability. I also implemented an 8 point grid system, added a color
          scheme, and adapted the interface to include Material Design
          Guidelines. An accessibility audit was also performed to make sure the
          design conformed to A guidelines at a minimum. Finally, I created a
          Style Guide in preparation for handoff to developers.

        <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h3>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <h4>Research - Finding the right people to interview</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          During the research phase of Vela it was challenging it was difficult
          to find individuals in my personal network who had water sports
          experience and matched my criteria, and it was also sometimes felt
          challenging to ask for the interview if I had not spoken with the
          contact in a long time. There were also some scheduling challenges
          with individuals who lived in different time zones. The lesson learned
          here is to over budget time for research to allow for any
          cancellations or scheduling mishaps. I overcame the challenge of
          sourcing individuals with persistence and not allowing myself to
          become discouraged if an interview did not work out. I was careful to
          follow up when setting up the interview and carefully explained the
          process to ensure the participant’s comfort.

        <h4>Design - Receiving Feedback</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          While designing the first concept of the design, I received some
          feedback that the navigation I had created may not be the easiest
          thing for a developer to build. Because of this, I had to rethink and
          come up with a new concept. The lesson learned for me here was that it
          is 1) Design is a constant work in progress and it’s important not to
          get attached to any one idea and 2) UX Design is very similar to
          architecture. Creating beautiful and innovative wireframes is great,
          but ultimately functionality is most important and someone has to be
          able to build the design.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Testing - Asking better questions</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          An additional finding from testing the prototype was how to write
          better usability testing questions. For instance, during testing
          participants had to ask for a particular question to be repeated
          multiple times. I realized that the question I wrote was too long,
          involved, and wordy. Participants could not remember what the question
          was asking them to do as they tried to complete the task. The lesson
          learned here is to remember that sometimes a question seems clear to
          the author but not so clear to someone hearing it for the first time.
          I learned to write better questions by reading them out loud, and by
          running the questions by friends and family to check for clarity.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Communicate Thoroughly and Frequently</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
          I think it is important to communicate very frequently with other team
          members, especially developers. When communicating, I think it is
          especially vital to share examples of the design so that everyone is
          on the same page, and there is plenty of opportunity to ask questions.
